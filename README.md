# Flight Tracker

Flight Tracker is a web application that allows users to track flights in real-time. It consists of a frontend built with React.js and Material UI, and a backend built with Nest.js and Node.js v16.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you have two options:

1 - Using Docker
2 - Running locally

## Using Docker

To use Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Once you have Docker installed, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and start the containers for the frontend and backend.

## Running Locally

To run the application locally, you need to have Node.js v16 installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js v16 installed, follow these steps:

1 - Navigate to the 'Flight-trackerFE' directory and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```

2 - Navigate to the 'Flight-trackerBE' directory and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start:dev
```

These commands will install the dependencies and start the frontend and backend servers, respectively.

## Usage

Once the servers are running, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
